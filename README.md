# SharpMIDI-raylib

Welcome to a very frankensteined version of EmK530's [SharpMIDI](https://github.com/EmK530/SharpMIDI)! where i added a (unfortunately vibe coded) renderer whilst i attempt to modify some more stuffs that this player already has.

## Quick info

pain and suffering

## Requirements

midi files maybe

IF you want pretty fast MIDI playback, Download [OmniMIDI](https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI/releases) to leverage [KDMAPI](https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI/blob/master/DeveloperContent/KDMAPI.md).

(Also supports XSynth DLLs on x64 builds of SharpMIDI. Make sure they are named "XSynth.dll"!!1111)

## Build Info

This originally used .NET 6.0, but now its upgraded to .NET 8.0.

i have no idea why and how to fix if you have problems building.
