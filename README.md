## Quick info

rahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

## Requirements

IF you want the absolute fastest of playbacks, Download [OmniMIDI](https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI/releases) to leverage [KDMAPI](https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI/blob/master/DeveloperContent/KDMAPI.md).

Also supports XSynth DLLs on x64 builds of SharpMIDI. Make sure they are named "XSynth.dll"

## Build Info

This originally used .NET 6.0, but now its upgraded to .NET 8.0.

i have no idea why and how to fix if you have problems building
